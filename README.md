As a little girl, Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden was my inspiration&#8212;making small discoveries that turn into life changing insights. I even went so far as to call myself Mary for a summer. Mary taught me much about tenacity, determination, dedication and the willingness to be open to new interpretations. As a scientist, methodologist, statistician, data analyst, and author I strive to embody these ideals. I received my Ph.D. in 2007 in Behavioral and Brain Sciences from the University of Texas at Dallas and my M.Sc. in Speech-Language Pathology in 2000 from the University of Western Ontario (now Western University). My goal is to share new insights, both in my scientific and literary works. See [lynnejwilliams.io](lynnejwilliams.io) for more details.
